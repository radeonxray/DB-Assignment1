# DB-Assignment1
Assignment 1 - Simple DB with Hashmap-based Index

- Build a simple_db in the programming language of your choice.
- Implement a Hashmap-based index.
- Implement functionality to store your data on disk in a binary file.
- Implement functionality to read your data from disk again, so that you can reinstantiate your database after a shutdown.

Hint: You do not want to serialize and deserialize the an in memory Hashmap containing all data directly. Instead, you in memory index based on a Hashmap contains information on where in you database file a piece of information is stored.
